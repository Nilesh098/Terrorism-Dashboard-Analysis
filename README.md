# Terrorism Dashboard project 


# Introduction

The Terrorism Dashboard project provides vital information about the dynamics of terrorism worldwide. Dates, locations, casualties, types of weapons, targeted populations, and affected locales are all analyzed. The easy-to-use dashboard may explore data relevant to each nation and historical patterns. Policymakers, scholars, and the general public may get diverse perspectives on terrorism through interactive elements. Using credible sources, it provides an extensive and well-structured database. In the end, the dashboard helps with decision-making, raises awareness, and supports the international campaign against terrorism.

1. Data Preparation: The Basis for Accuracy
• Added raw data to the PowerBI import.
• Carefully deleting superfluous (unneeded) columns and handling null values from the data.
• Renaming columns to make them more user-friendly.
• aligning and verifying the data type for accuracy.

2. Data visualization: creating a story through visuals 
• Showed the annual trends in terrorist attacks.
• made use of a map whose bubble size indicated higher attack counts for geographical patterns that are dynamic.
•Finds that explosives are the most effective full attack. 
• Indicates that civilians are the ones most frequently attacked;
• Since 2011, there have been rising trends in both attacks and casualties.

3. Interactive Dashboard: Giving users more power to investigate
• created a highly configurable dashboard with drill-through capabilities, filters, and separators.
• Made dynamic exploration available to users in real time.
• displayed information in a way that prompted users to draw their own judgments.

4. Analysis-Based Insights: Revealing the Tale
• The most affected region is said to be the Middle East, especially Iraq.
• South Asia is heavily affected, notably Pakistan and India. 
• The Taliban became a major force.
• It was evident that the most effective attack method was explosives.
• Attack frequency has been gradually declining since 2014 after rising in 2011.

5. Crucial Performance Measures:
A Quantitative analysis 
• The total number of terrorist attacks indicated the overall size.
• Based on deaths, determine which group was the deadliest.
• Determined which year had the highest number of attacks on file.
